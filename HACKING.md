# If you want to get involved...

This is meant to be a really small project. If you *really really* want to get involved, you can find me (**ansuz**) on irc (EFNet or HypeIRC), and discuss what you think you can contribute (and how to go about doing it).

Pull requests featuring example snippets or unit tests are quite likely to be accepted.

I'm not too picky about code style, though as you'll see by reading the source, I like to indent using two spaces.
