# If you want to get involved...

This is meant to be a really small project. If you *really really* want to get involved, you can find me (**ansuz**) on irc (EFNet or HypeIRC), and discuss what you think you can contribute (and how to go about doing it).

Pull requests featuring example snippets or unit tests are quite likely to be accepted. I'm using Buster.js for tests, since I've used it before, and it's quite full featured. You can install everything you need for buster by running `npm install`, and then run the tests with `npm test`.

I'm not too picky about code style, though as you'll see by reading the source, I like to indent using two spaces.
