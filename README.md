***************

I use Javascript for just about everything these days. The language features that I actually use only comprise a very small fraction of the language, though.

I accomplish nearly every task by using lambdas in conjunction with array methods.

The libraries included in this repository are the result of my efforts to implement complex behaviour generally associated with languages like Haskell and Prolog in a readable fashion. 

I found other Javascript libraries that claimed to do this, but they all seemed bent on imposing their own syntax upon the language, rather than exposing the fact that Javascript can already do these things quite easily.

Unix philosophy states that we should favour composability over monolithic design. Many of these functions work entirely on their own, but I've bundled together those which have some cohesive theme.

I haven't used the `this` or `new` keyword even once, and I don't foresee having to in the future. Stick to this subset of JS, and you will minimize the scoping and off-by-one errors so commonly encountered in imperative or object oriented JS.

Godspeed, brave hacker.
